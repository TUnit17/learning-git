Starting to put out a feeler for the blob, sometimes gotta do what ya gotta do to move forward. Miles will go up slowly and the car will see a track day this weekend. Not in a Rush to sell. 
 Let me start off by saying I absolutely love this car and it was not an easy choice but it's time for me to move on from my blob. Need to sell the car to move into a shop space and I want to build a new platform outside of only STIs. The car is stupid fast for street use and I don't need two high horsepower STIs. The car is 100% Mechanically sound and is completely overbuilt for what it is. The entire build of this car is documented on Youtube as well for if you're needing any reference to anything done with it.
