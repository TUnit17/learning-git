## situation
1. funds from previous employer
2. backdoor roth conversion


## options
1. keep the funds in my traditional from Boeing 401k
2. move everything in traditional to Roth conversion : rollover amount is unlimited, but new contribution amount is limited
a. roll over request == internal transfer 

## how does the IRS keep track of all this?
tax documentation 1099 is distribution 
105498 = document any distrubution out of IRA account
